.SH NAME
printf - format and print the input character string.

.SH SYNOPSIS
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION

This project is similar to a part of the printf function.
Its functionality is to print ARGUMENTS according to FORMAT.

.SH OPTIONS

A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.  The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.B d, i 
.RS
The  int  argument  is  converted to signed decimal notation and write this on new string (format modified).

.RE
.B c
.RS
The int argument is converted to an char, and the resulting character is written on new string (format modified). 

.RE
.B s
.RS
write a string on new string (format modified). If string does not exist prints "(null)" in the same position.

.RE
.B %
.RS
A '%' is written in new string (format modified).  No argument is converted.  The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE

Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null  byte  used  to  end  output  to strings). 

.SH EXAMPLES

To call the _printf() function the next code is required:

#include "main.h"

int main() 
.TP
\r{
.TP
	_printf("Let's try to printf a simple sentence.");
.TP
	return (0);
.TP
\r}

.TP
an example of how does the parameters work in our _printf() function:
.TP
#include "main.h"
.TP
int main()
.TP
\r{
.TP
	_printf("Holbertonschool Cohort C22: %i .%s", 22, "The best cohort in the world.");
.TP
	return (0);
.TP
\r}
.TP
The output of this main function will be:
.TP
Holbertonschool Cohort: 22 .The best cohort in the world.
